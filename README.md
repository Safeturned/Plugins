# Safeturned Loader

A loader for Unturned servers that automatically checks your plugins for backdoors and malicious code.

## What is this?

This is a loader module that you install on your Unturned server. Once installed, it runs in the background and keeps your server safe by automatically scanning plugins.

## How it works

1. **Install the loader** on your Unturned server (just like any other loader)
2. **Add your API key** from your Safeturned account
3. **The loader watches** your plugin folders (Rocket, OpenMod, Vanilla)
4. **When you add or update a plugin**, the loader notices
5. **It uploads the plugin** to Safeturned's API
6. **You get notified** if anything suspicious is found

That's it. No manual uploads, no checking files yourself. Just install and forget.

## Features

- Works with Rocket, OpenMod, and Vanilla plugins
- Scans new plugins automatically when you install them
- Checks existing plugins when they get updated
- Connects to Safeturned API (already live and running)
- Lightweight and runs in the background. No libraries ;)
