Safeturned Loader
----------------
Drop the `Safeturned.Loader` folder into your server’s `Modules` directory. Keep the folder whole (don’t just copy the files).  
Restart/Start server. After server's loaded go to Modules/Safeturned.Module and edit `config.json` to add your API key (get your api key on https://safeturned.com/dashboard/api-keys) and adjust any settings.  
Then restart Unturned so it picks up your changes.
